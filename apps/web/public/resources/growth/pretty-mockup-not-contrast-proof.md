# A beautiful AI mockup is not proof of readable contrast

Do not judge text contrast from a generated screenshot alone. Antialiasing, gradients and guessed colours make visual inspection an unreliable substitute for measuring the actual foreground and background.

## A small test with real colours

Try gold #D4971B on cream #FDF7EE, white #FFFFFF on burgundy #7C1F16, and warm grey #84766A on cream #FDF7EE. Enter the actual hex pairs into the contrast calculator in the linked activity. Record the ratio and whether the pair meets the relevant threshold.

## Keep the thresholds separate

- WCAG AA ordinary text generally needs 4.5:1.
- Large text generally needs 3:1, using the standard size/weight definitions—not merely a large-looking screenshot.
- A contrast pass alone is not a complete accessibility audit: keyboard use, names, structure, focus and other requirements remain.

## Make a change and test again

Choose one failing pair. Change the actual text colour or background in an editable heading or button, then recompute the ratio. Keep the before/after values and one remaining limitation. Do not declare the entire interface accessible from this single test.
